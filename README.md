# Java Joke Generator
Project for Basic Programming I700 for the Estonian IT College by Oliver Aasmets.

The purpose of this project is to provide people with an icebreaker. I have scoured the Internet for jokes that got a smile out of me and have compiled a couple of lists with them.

Currently, if you wish to use the program, you would need to open it up in Eclipse and run any of the class files under jokeLists. It will save you the trouble of having to make a choice and will print a randomly selected one into the console - helpful if you're short on time.
