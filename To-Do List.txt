Project will be a silly little joke generator.
Project is possibly going to be titled "Icebreaker" for its potential utility in opening a conversation.

Things to do:

1. Set up a webpage/make a text-based application, leaning towards the latter
2. Create 5 categories of jokes
3. Find at least 20 jokes for each category
4. Add a way to insert jokes into one of the 5 categories
5. Create an user interface to let user pick from categories

Scrapped "joke generator" idea, it would only work best for two or three-word sentences and the only amusement from it would stem from absurdity.

Project outline

Make these into 5 lists in one class file. Have to find the most efficient way to actually incorporate sentences into a list.
Joke categories:
"One Liners"
"Political"
"Stereotypes"
"Dark humour"
"IT/business jokes"

Also a "random" category that picks a random joke from any of the 5 categories.

Should maybe add a way for an user to insert their own joke that will be added into either an "User input" list or an existing one.

The user interface shouldn't be too flashy, just a standard box with 7 clickable buttons, an "execute" lever/bar and a popup text box for custom jokes if added.

Somewhat ready content:

User Interface Graphics
Jokes that haven't been integrated into lists yet
