Project will be a silly little joke generator.
Project is possibly going to be titled "Icebreaker" for its potential utility in opening a conversation.

Things to do:

1. Set up a webpage/make a text-based application, leaning towards the latter
2. Create 5 categories of jokes
3. Find at least 20 jokes for each category
4. Create an user interface to let user pick from categories without the use of an IDE - opted for pop-up boxes instead.

Scrapped "joke generator" idea, it would only work best for two or three-word sentences and the only amusement from it would stem from absurdity.

Project outline

Make these into 5 lists in one class file. Have to find the most efficient way to actually incorporate sentences into a list.
Joke categories:
"One-liners" (Give me something simple!)
"Political" (Make fun of politicians, their antics and the countries they run!)
"Stereotypes" (Give me something that goes beyond Political Correctness!)
"Dark humour" (Make me laugh and sad!)

Funny jokes were damn hard to find.
