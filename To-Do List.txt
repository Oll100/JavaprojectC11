Project will be a joke generator.

Things to do:

1. Set up a webpage
2. Create 5 categories of jokes
3. Find at least 20 jokes for each category
4. Add a way to insert jokes into one of the 5 categories
5. Create an user interface to let user pick from categories

Potential addition

6. If there is any leftover time, create an actual "generator" using random strings, taking inspiration from how Dwarf Manager generates its world
